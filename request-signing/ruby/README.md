# Ruby Example

This example uses only the built in `openssl` module to sign requests.

## Production Use

The private key used is an example key that is disclosed widely in the documentation and examples for this service. You should use your own private key that you generate as part of the onboarding process.

Please store your private key securely using a service like AWS SecretsManager and retrieve it as needed.

## Running

This is a ruby console application which can be run with

```
$ ruby main.rb
```

There are no dependencies that need to be installed.
